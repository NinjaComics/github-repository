     * \brief OFDM frame equalizer
     * \ingroup ofdm_blk
     *
     * \details
     * Performs equalization in one or two dimensions on a tagged OFDM frame.
     *
     * This does two things:
     * First, it removes the coarse carrier offset. If a tag is found on the first
     * item with the key 'ofdm_sync_carr_offset', this is interpreted as the coarse
     * frequency offset in number of carriers.
     * Next, it performs equalization in one or two dimensions on a tagged OFDM frame.
     * The actual equalization is done by a ofdm_frame_equalizer object, outside of
     * the block.
     *
     * Note that the tag with the coarse carrier offset is not removed. Blocks
     * downstream from this block must not attempt to also correct this offset.
     *
     * Input: a tagged series of OFDM symbols.
     * Output: The same as the input, but equalized and frequency-corrected.
